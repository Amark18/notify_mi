## Notify Me
üîî Notify Me simplifies sending yourself text and email notifications from your personal projects by utilizing your gmail account. It is a convenient and cost-effective solution with the goal of providing you an `easy` and `free` way to send messages in response to events.

Notify Me is particularly useful when working with IoT devices. It can allow you to receive messages in response to events such as when a sensor value reaches a certain threshold, when a sensor detects something, when a sensor encounters an error, or when a daily or custom timed event occurs. This makes it easy to keep track of what is happening with your IoT device and react to any change or issue that may arise.

With Notify Me, you can also `attach a file` with your text or email message. The maximum file size allowed is 1 MB and you can use any of the 69 supported file types, thus providing you flexibility in the type of attachment you want to include in your messages.

#### Purpose:

Sending notifications through your Gmail account is not a novel idea. Notify Me is designed to be a `modular` and `reliable` way to send notifications without having to spend time and effort figuring out how to do it each time you want to add this feature to your project. Plus, the implementation process should be straightforward and `take only a few minutes`. This way, you can focus on other aspects of your project and save time.
